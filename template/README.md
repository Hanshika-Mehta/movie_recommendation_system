## Steps to work on the repository:
Use Git Bash to run all the commands.

1. Clone the repository. 
2. Create a branch in your name (use all small letters. This is case-sensitive).

Use command to create a branch.

    git checkout -b your_name

and

    git checkout your_name

to switch to your branch. Intially, you are automatically transferred to the newly created branch. The current branch is visible at the bottom left corner in Visual Studio Code. In case you wish to switch to the master branch just write

    git checkout master

3. Open the entire folder in Visual Studio Code
4. Work on the assigned pages. Just comment out all irrelevant elements. Select irrelevant things and press "Shift + /". Do NOT delete any element. They may be used someday.

Save the work in your branch. Then add all files to the next commit
    
    git add -A

and then to commit, write a message in the inverted commas describing your work. P.S: Keep it short.

    git commit -a -m "Your_message"

Finally, to push the changes onto your branch on GitHub

    git push origin your_name

To update your version of project, head over to master branch using checkout command mentioned above and then write

    git pull origin master

Repeat this process whenever you want to publish changes for merging it finally.<br>
